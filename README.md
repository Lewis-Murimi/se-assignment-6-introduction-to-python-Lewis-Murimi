# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

To help you with your assignment, here are detailed answers to each of the questions based on your requirements:

### Python Basics

**What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key features include:
- **Easy-to-learn syntax:** Python's syntax resembles pseudo-code, making it accessible to beginners.
- **Extensive standard library:** Python comes with a large collection of modules and libraries for various tasks.
- **Dynamically typed:** Python doesn't require explicit variable declarations.
- **Cross-platform:** Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Python is popular in web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), artificial intelligence (TensorFlow, PyTorch), automation (Selenium, BeautifulSoup), and scripting.

### Installing Python

**Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.**

Installation steps vary slightly based on the OS:

1. **Windows:**
   - Download Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Run the installer, select "Add Python to PATH."
   - Open Command Prompt and type `python --version` to verify.

2. **macOS:**
   - Install via Homebrew (`brew install python3`) or download installer.
   - Verify with `python3 --version` in Terminal.

3. **Linux:**
   - Use package manager (`sudo apt-get install python3` for Debian/Ubuntu).
   - Verify with `python3 --version`.

**Setting up a virtual environment:**
- Install `virtualenv` using `pip install virtualenv`.
- Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`.
- Activate environment:
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Python Syntax and Semantics

**Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.**

```python
# Hello World program
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print()` is a built-in function to output text.
- `"Hello, World!"` is a string enclosed in double quotes.

### Data Types and Variables

**List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.**

Basic data types:
- **int**: Integer numbers (`x = 10`)
- **float**: Floating-point numbers (`y = 3.14`)
- **str**: Strings (`name = "Alice"`)
- **bool**: Boolean values (`is_valid = True`)
- **list**: Ordered collection (`numbers = [1, 2, 3]`)
- **dict**: Key-value pairs (`person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}`)

```python
# Variables of different data types
x = 10  # int
y = 3.14  # float
name = "Alice"  # str
is_valid = True  # bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # list
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}  # dict
```

### Control Structures

**Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.**

- **Conditional statement (if-else):**
```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

- **For loop:**
```python
# Iterating through a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

### Functions in Python

**What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.**

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They enhance code readability and reusability.

```python
# Function to calculate sum of two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8
```

### Lists and Dictionaries

**Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.**

- **Lists** are ordered collections of items accessed by index.
- **Dictionaries** are unordered collections of key-value pairs.

```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary of person's attributes
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Accessing elements
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Adding elements
numbers.append(6)
person["job"] = "Engineer"

# Iterating through elements
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key + ":", value)
```

### Exception Handling

**What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.**

Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors that occur during program execution.

```python
# Example of exception handling
try:
    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")

# Output:
# Error: Division by zero!
# Execution completed.
```

### Modules and Packages

**Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.**

Modules are files containing Python code, and packages are directories of modules.

```python
# Example of using the math module
import math

radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print("Area of the circle:", area)  # Output: Area of the circle: 78.53981633974483
```

### File I/O

**How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.**

```python
# Reading from a file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Writing to a file
lines = ['Line 1\n', 'Line 2\n', 'Line 3\n']
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```
